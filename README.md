# Asset Store 
## Overwiew
This is the first project where I created fully working REST Api, that connects to the database and sends correct responses to frontend. Inspired by [Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com)
## Tools I used ðŸ› 
- [React](https://react.dev)
- [NestJS](https://nestjs.com)
- [Mantine](https://mantine.dev)
- [Tabler](https://tabler.io/icons)
- [Filebase](https://filebase.com/)
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com)
## Functionalities âœ…
- User authentication with JWT + registration & login page
- Searching for the specific asset with search bar
